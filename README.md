Inline [markdown][] formatting and [pygments][] syntax highlighting plugin for the [Adium][] chat client.

**FAIR WARNING:** I never claimed to know Objective-C *or* Cocoa. Use at your own risk.

##Chat about code like your write about code


##Why?

I'm a web developer. I chat a lot with other developers. Textual conversation and programming vocabulary can get very dicey ("put this before this. No, *that*, not *this*!"). Inline `code` references and [markdown formatting][] make the task of talking about `code` a *whole lot* **easier**.
