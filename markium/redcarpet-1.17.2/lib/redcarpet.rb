# Upskirt is an implementation of John Gruber's Markdown markup
# language. Upskirt is safe, fast and production ready.
#
# Redcarpet is Upskirt with a touch of Ruby. It is mostly based on Ryan
# Tomayko's RDiscount, and inspired by Rick Astley wearing a kilt.
#
# Redcarpet is a drop-in replacement for BlueCloth, RedCloth and RDiscount.
#
# == Usage
#
# Redcarpet implements the basic protocol popularized by RedCloth and adopted
# by BlueCloth:
#   require 'redcarpet'
#   markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
#   puts markdown.to_html
#
# == Replacing BlueCloth
#
# Inject Redcarpet into your BlueCloth-using code by replacing your bluecloth
# require statements with the following:
#   begin
#     require 'redcarpet'
#     BlueCloth = Redcarpet
#   rescue LoadError
#     require 'bluecloth'
#   end
#
